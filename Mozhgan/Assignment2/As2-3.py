# mgrid: Construct a multi-dimensional “meshgrid” using indexing notation.

# ogrid: Construct an open multi-dimensional “meshgrid” using indexing notation.

# Unlike mgrid() function, which converts indexes into dense mesh grids of the same sizes,
# the Ogrid stands for “open grid.”It basically provides a way to act on an image’s specific pixels based on
# their row and column index.
